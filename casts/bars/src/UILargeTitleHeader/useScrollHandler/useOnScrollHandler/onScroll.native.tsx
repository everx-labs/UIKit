/**
 * Ok, so what scenario we can be at the moment?
 * Let's start with the first render and the first touch event that might happen
 * All is stable at the moment and we have all in the initial place
 * That mean, that our starting point should be 0 at the point.
 *
 * From here we have two possible scenarious:
 * 1. up
 * 2. down
 *
 * in both those scenarious we will reset scrolling for scroll view,
 * so that mean, that contentOffset.y (`coY`) won't represent actual coords,
 * it's just kinda a difference between events.
 * (TODO: can we guarantee that scrollTo will happen exactly between those events?
 *        what if not?
 *        what should we do then?
 *        can we put a guard somehow?
 *        * hypothesis to check - is it fires an event with `coY` == 0? it will be so easier this way)
 *        * another hypothesis to check, so the thought is that (looks very weak)
 *          when movement continues, the `coY` will increase
 *          until the reset will happen. So when the coord is less than the previous diff
 *          we may distinct it. A lot of problems actually:
 *          - What if one started to pull it very fast
 *            then we might get a `coY` that is bigger than
 *            all the previous diff.
 *          - What if one in between starts to move at the opposite direction?
 *            that would break all the logic. Same with straifing.
 *
 * At the moment we should just apply that diff to our context variable.
 *
 * The to the bottom movement is actually pretty easy to handle,
 * just apply diff and calculate the rubber band effect.
 *
 * The upward movement is a bit more interesting
 * as there we should apply `scrollTo` only until
 * (currentCoord - coY) > -1 * headerHeight
 * (TODO: we actually might distinct when coord become bigger than headerHeight
 *        and apply scrollTo with proper offset (do we really need this?))
 *
 * The rest is not that interesting, as it's just a usual scroll.
 * (TODO: should we track our coord here, just not to lose anything,
 *        or it's better to do less work there?)
